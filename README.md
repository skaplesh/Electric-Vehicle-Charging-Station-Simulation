## 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project from the Git repository using the following command:

```bash
https://github.com/skaplesh/Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Station-Simulation/tree/main

## **Dataset** 

The project uses the `station_data_dataverse.csv` dataset, which includes data on EV charging sessions such as:
- `sessionId`: Unique identifier for each charging session
- `kwhTotal`: Total kilowatt-hours charged
- `dollars`: Charging cost in dollars
- `startTime`, `endTime`: Charging session start and end times
- `chargeTimeHrs`: Duration of the charging session in hours
- Additional fields covering weekday, location, and facility type.

Ensure the dataset is placed in the `station_data_dataverse.csv` directory or update the path in the Jupyter Notebook as necessary.
