## 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project from the Git repository using the following command:

```bash
https://github.com/skaplesh/Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Station-Simulation
```

## 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Station-Simulation
```

## 3. Install Python
Ensure that Python is installed on your machine, with a minimum version of 3.6.6 and a maximum version of 3.8.9. You can check your Python version with:

```bash
python --version
```

If you need to install Python, download and install the correct version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

## 4. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. Navigate to the Code Directory
Change into the code directory:

```bash
cd code
```

## 6. Set Up Environment Variables
Rename the `env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
mv env.example .env
```

## 7. Run the Simulation
Finally, run the simulation program using the following command:

```bash
python EV_Charging_Simulation.ipynb
```

## Dataset
The simulation uses the dataset `station_data_dataverse.csv`, which contains relevant data for EV charging station operations.
